With the local content API you can fetch files based on for example the route.
The API will automatically try to fetch one of the following file types:

* .md ([Markdown](http://commonmark.org/help/))
* .json (Javascript Object)
* .html (Plain HTML)

The files are located in the `content/pages` folder in the root of the project.
Then it will follow the path defined including sub-folders.

You need to post the "path" in the body of an fetch just like the example below,
or you can find it in the `src/routes/generic/index.js`.
In the generic route there is a example on how to load a markdown file using the LocalAPI
and then putting it in the DefaultPage component

```js static
const resp = await fetch(`/api/content`, {
  method: `post`,
  headers: {
    Accept: `application/json`,
    'Content-Type': `application/json`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    path: `${path}`,
  }),
});
```
